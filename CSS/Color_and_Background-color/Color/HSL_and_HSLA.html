    <h1>HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness)</h1>
    <pre>
    <b>Hue(h):</b>
Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.
    <b>Saturation (S)</b>:
Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
0% saturation is no color (grayscale),  and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.
    <b>Lightness (L)</b>:
Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.
    </pre>

    <h1>HSLA(Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha value)</h1>
    <p>
<b>A</b> stands for <b>Alpha value</b>, which is used to set the opacity. Alpha values lie between 0 and 1.
