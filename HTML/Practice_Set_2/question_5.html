    <pre>A Wikipedia article or entry is a page on this site that has encyclopedic information on it. A well-written encyclopedia article:

        identifies a notable topic,
        summarizes that topic comprehensively,
        is written in an encyclopedic style of language,
        has been well copyedited,
        contains references to reliable sources, and
        contains wikilinks to and is linked to by other articles or article sections about related topics.
        Most articles consist of paragraphs and images (perhaps with other types of audiovisual media). However, articles may also be formatted as stand-alone lists or tables (not to be confused with disambiguation pages, which are purely navigation aids). These lists or tables are also considered articles for Wikipedia's purposes and are included in the Main/Article namespace, the one without a title prefix followed by a colon (:).</pre>
